A small ruby script that got to long.

Adds your steam library to http://backloggery.com

There are some quirks with some utf8 (mostly (tm) in the end of some game names), so you might have to
remove some crap from the end of some game names

Usage
====
bundle install

./backloggery_steam.rb backloggery_username [steam_username]
